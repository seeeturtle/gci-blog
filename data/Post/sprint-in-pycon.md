Have you ever heard about **sprint**? Sprint is a event of Pycon that aims to contribute to OSS project with maintainers of the project.
I think the first contribution I made was from sprint. It was August, 2017. I went to my first conference, Pycon Korea. The event was really
exciting. I listened great presentations, meet new people, talk with various people. I loved the atmosphere around the conference, 
and it was really fantastic. Moreover, I knew that there was free program that let people to contribute projects with maintainers. So I attended
one, which was `aiodocker`. If I say that briefly, it's asynchronous Docker API client.

I didn't even know what asynchronous means but the maintainer was kind and helped me even though I was quite annoying.
With lots of help from the maintainer, I've made a PR. Yeah, my first PR. I was really glad to see purple text that says my PR is merged.
I bet that sprint helped me to lead to Google Code-in. So if you have chance to participate on Pycon, or if you are afraid to start contributing
OSS projects, join sprint, it will be fun!
