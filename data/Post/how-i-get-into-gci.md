It was last year winter that I found Google Code-in. At that time, I was not passionate with programing.
I need someone to talk with me and work with me. However, by chance, I saw Google Code-in and thought: 
This is the contest for me! I could practice my English skill and I can even contribute to big OSS projects 
(and even trip to Google Headquarter if you're grand prize winner)! So I ran into the site to apply the contest.

I think my choice -- to enter GCI -- was really a **good** choice.
After the contest, I became a collaborator of a project, got new interest of language analysis, and meet great people.
I have also struggled with `pyflakes` to solve problem that was harder than the problem that was written in the task; 
it was quite exciting experience because I finished the hard task just before the deadline of the content (not the task)!

I really appreciate those who encouraged me, escpecially `jayvdb`, `manu-chroma`, and all the mentors. I also appreciate
to the all the great participants, `coala` members, and the ones who made this contest into real world.

I hope someone else like me would become passionate again through this contest. Though, as a asian student,
English is quite a big barrier. But, the mentors are kind and generous. They even taught me something like "iirc", "jbtw" and so on.
You can find me asking "What does blah stands for?" or "What does blah means?" *a lot*. So, I want to say to asian student that even
though you are not really good at english, please try this contest. It's really a good chance to enhance and test your skill.
